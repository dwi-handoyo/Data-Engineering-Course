# Data Engineering Course

## Learning Progress Review - Week 1

#### Introduction to Data Engineering and Basics Python (Python Programming I) 
Data Engineering is interesting topics, even though currently it is not as widely discussed as Data Science and Data Analysis. But actually, Data Engineer role has importance for providing good quality data for analytics, reports, Machine Learning modelling, etc. No wonder if in my personal research, I found out the trend of high demand for Data Engineer roles by the companies. I believe there will be more job opportunities available in the near future.

Previously data analytical architecture is part of Software Engineer scope of works. But as the data became bigger in volume, faster in traffic, more various, and more issue in its integrity, a specialist is required to handle the data infrastructure. The Software Engineer role then replaced by a Data Engineer who fit the purpose which is bridging the Tech Team (Software Engineer at back end) with Data Team (Data Analyst and Data Scientist). Software Engineer responsible for transactional database, while Data Engineer responsible for analytical database.

Data Engineer main tasks are including:
* Data Extraction & Processing (ETL pipeline)
* Data Warehousing (Storage size and query time optimization, security)
* Business Intelligence (Transform data to actionable insights, eg. from dashboard mock up to automated dashboard)
* Data Automation (Comprehensive periodic data, eg. quarterly report)
* Cloud Engineering (Migration of on-premise server to cloud, data lake)

During first week of the course, I learnt about introduction to data engineering and basics of python. It is widely used programming language in data engineering. As basic knowledge in Python, the topics are covering primitive data types (integer, string, float, and boolean) and non primitive data types (list, tuple, set, and dictionary). Summary of the course in week 1 can be found in attach document.
